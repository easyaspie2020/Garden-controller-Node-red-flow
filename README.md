This flow is designed to be used by a rpi, in particular the rpi zero w, but can be modified to be used by any pi

To load your pi with node red:
https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/raspberrypi

To use this controller, Copy my code and paste into the flow editor via 'Import' @ [yourPiIpAddr]:1880/flow in your favorite web browser.
Web Dashboard @ [yourPiIpAddr]:1880/ui

I also recommend using zerotier to access your pi from any device, anywhere. It is also one of the easiest methods to get a static ip address.
